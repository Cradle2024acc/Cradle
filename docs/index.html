                        increasingly digital world,
                        provide countless rich software, including applications and realistic video games for agents
                        to interact with, while avoiding the challenges of robots in reality, such as hardware
                        requirements, constraints of practicability, and possible catastrophic failures. Mastering these
                        virtual environments is a promising path for foundation agents to achieve
                        generalizability. Therefore, we propose the <span style="font-weight: bold">General Computer Control (GCC)</span>
                        setting:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Building <span style="font-weight: bold">foundation agents</span> that can master <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">ANY</span> computer task via the universal human-style interface
                        by receiving input from screens and audio and outputting keyboard and mouse actions.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        There are many challenges to achieving GCC: i) good alignment across multi-modalities for better
                        understanding and decision-making;
                        ii) precise control of keyboard and mouse to interact with the computer, which has a large,
                        hybrid action space, including not only which key to press and where the mouse to move, but also the
                        duration of the press and the speed of the mouse movement; iii) long-horizontal reasoning due to the
                        partial observability of complex GCC tasks, which also leads to the demand for long-term memory to
                        maintain past useful experiences; and iv) efficient exploration in a structured
                        manner to discover better strategies and solutions autonomously, i.e., self-improving, which can
                        allow agents to generalize across the myriad tasks in the digital world.

                        To pursue GCC, we propose <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span>, a modular and flexible
                        LMM-powered framework that can properly handle the challenges GCC presents.
                        The framework should have the ability to understand and interpret computer screens and dynamic
                        changes between consecutive frames from arbitrary software and be able to generate reasonable
                        computer control actions to be executed precisely. This suggests that a multimodal model with
                        powerful vision and reasoning capabilities, in addition to rich knowledge of computer UI and
                        control, is a requirement. In this work, we leverage GPT-4o as the framework's backbone model.

                        The figure shows that <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> can efficiently complete simple navigation tasks with
                        a few steps like following an NPC or going to specific locations on the ground
                        (e.g., <em>Follow Dutch</em>,  <em>Go to Town </em> and  <em>Go to Barn</em>). Another following task,
                         <em>Follow Javier </em>, and the searching task,  <em>Search John</em>, are dangerous
                        for the rugged and winding path up to the snow mountain with cliffs. Note that Cradle
                        is able to retry the checkpoint automatically according to the game guidance if the task fails.
                        Therefore, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> takes more steps for retrying the task in these dangerous areas.
                        In addition, Cradle spends about one-fourth of the total steps in the task of
                        <em>Protect Dutch</em>, which is a long-horizontal task with nighttime combat. Many key skills
                        are generated in this task for weapon management and shooting movement. The visibility is very
                        poor due to the snow falling in the dark, which prevents GPT-4o from accurately recognizing and
                        locating enemies or objects and precisely timing decisions, even equipped with Grounding DINO as
                        an additional detection tool. More times of retry, combined with the need for frequent interactions
                        during combat and the long horizon of the task, lead to this task requiring a large number of steps
                        to complete. The success rate of the combat has significantly improved during the day with much fewer
                        steps for completion, as shown by tasks like <em>Keep Wolves away</em>. Additionally, indoor tasks
                        like <em>Search for Supplies</em> are also challenging due to GPT4-o's limited spatial perception,
                        which finds it difficult to locate target objects and ends up circling aimlessly around the house.
                        Moreover, the room contains numerous interactive items unrelated to the task, resulting in much more
                        steps for the agent to complete the task. Overall, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> requires approximately 8,000 steps to
                        complete both missions, taking around 98 minutes of in-game time, compared to the average of 67 minutes
                        for human players. It is the first time for LMM-powered AI agents to exhibit comparable performance
                        in complex AAA games.

                            <strong>Cities: Skylines:</strong>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> is able to complete most of the city design with the averaged maximal population of 450
                            and the highest single population exceeding 860. <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> manages to build the roads in a closed
                            loop to ensure smooth traffic flow, place multiple wind turbines to provide sufficient electricity
                            supply and cover more than 90% of available area with residential, commercial and industrial zones,
                            but fails to provide sufficient water supply for all the regions reliably. The most common failure
                            arises from the missing of water pipes. <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> often fail to connect them with each other to cover all zones,
                            resulting in localized water shortages in the city, and preventing new residents from moving in.
                            The issue also arises from GPT-4o's limited visual understanding, making it difficult to accurately recognize
                            which areas are already covered by the water pipes. We empirically observed that these mistakes usually could
                            be fixed within three unit operations (building or removing a road/facility/a place of zones is counted as one unit operation).
                            Then cities built by <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> can eventually reach a population of more than one thousand. Overall, without the manual fixes,
                            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> still beats human players even though it suffers from local water storage. 
                            Human players typically pay insufficient attention to budget management and tend to allocate a 
                            disproportionate amount of funds to the construction of wind turbines for electricity, resulting 
                            in limited road construction and residential areas to attract residents.

                            <strong>Stardew Valley:</strong>
                            As shown in the table, we surprisingly find that GPT-4o  struggles with accurately recognizing and locating objects
                            near the player in this pixel-art game. This leads to difficulties for the agent to interact with objects or people, 
                            as it requires the player to stand precisely in front of them in the grid (e.g., when entering doors, using a pickaxe to break stones).
                            It explains the inefficiency in the farming task though the agent manages to clear up most of the obstacles in front 
                            of the house within 100 steps and poor performance in the shopping task. On the other hand, relying on episodic summarization 
                            and task inference, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> manages to obtain the parsnip by watering the seed for four days and harvesting.
                            Given GPT-4's limited visual capabilities in this game, there is still room for improvement in narrowing the gap between 
                            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> and human players.

                            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> demonstrates robust performance and efficient profit-making on the <em>Weekly Shop Management</em> task, successfully 
                            finalizing 93.6% of potential transactions, with an average of 2 negotiation rounds per customer, and generally aiming for a 
                            profit rate of over 50% at the initial offer. It consistently generates profit across all runs, maintaining a total profit 
                            rate of +39.6%, peaking at +87.4% in a single run. In this game, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> significantly outperforms human players.
                            The achievements are mainly attributed to its cautious strategy, by bargaining within a smaller range of price variation
                            but haggling more frequently, resulting in a significantly higher turnover rate. In contrast, human players usually fail 
                            the deal due to their aggressive strategy by proposing an unreasonable price and sometimes confusing buying and selling.

                        Multiple tasks remain challenging. Even with a well-known GUI, like Chrome and Outlook, GPT-4o
                        still cannot recognize specific UI items to interact with and also struggles with visual
                        context. For example, it may forget to press the Save button in an open dialog, or not
                        distinguish between a nearby enabled button versus a distant and disabled one (e.g., when
                        posting on Twitter). The phenomenon is more severe in UIs with non-standard layouts, like
                        CapCut, Meitu, and Feishu. Lacking prior knowledge, GPT-4o fails in task inference and selecting
                        the correct skills.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> achieves the overall highest success rate in
                        OSWorld, compared to the baselines, at 7.81% without relying on any internal APIs to provide extra
                        grounding labels, Set-of-Mark (SoM).
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span>'s information gathering module improves grounding
                        for more precise action execution, increasing its performance. The self-reflection module
                        greatly helps it to correctly predict infeasible tasks and subsequently fix mistakes, as
                        exemplified in the professional domain results, where it achieves a 20.41% success rate,
                        significantly surpassing the baselines.

                        In this work, we introduce GCC, a general and challenging setting with a unified and standard
                        interface for control of diverse video games and other software (via screenshots, and keyboard and mouse operations),
                        paving the way towards general foundation agents across all digital world tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To properly address the challenges GCC presents, we propose a novel open-source framework, <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span>, which exhibits strong performance in reasoning and
                        performing actions to accomplish real missions or tasks in a set of complex video games and
                        common software applications. To the best of our knowledge, <span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span>
                        is the first framework that enables foundation agents to succeed in such a diverse set of
                        environments without relying on any built-in APIs. The success of <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> greatly extends the reach of foundation agents and
                        demonstrates the feasibility of converting any software, especially complex games, into
                        benchmarks to evaluate agents' general intelligence and facilitate further data collection for self-improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although<span style="font-weight: bold">Cradle</span> can still face difficulties in certain tasks, it
                        serves as a pioneering work to develop more powerful
                        LMM-based general agents across computer control tasks, combining both further framework
                        enhancements and new advances in LMMs.
